                       Once you book a shoot with us, the first order of business is a one-on-one consultation with Model Mentor Tarun Rajput wherein the mood of your shoot will be decided according to your goals and aspirations. 
                       </p>
                       <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-justify">
On the day of your shoot, a team of expert stylists, MUAs and Photographers gather to bring to life the Moodboard that has been prepared beforehand to ensure a smooth and stress-free shoot experience. 
</p>
                       <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-justify">
Your only tasks are to follow the instructions given to you before the shoot, and then some during the shoot as Tarun guides you through movements, expressions, and poses.

                       <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-justify">
Since this is an end-to-end service, we select the best shots out of your entire shoot, get them edited, and share with you to be added as-is to your digital portfolio.
